# wavefront
Python API for fm3d wavefront propagation code. - (in development)

The goal of this development project is to create a convenient API to interface with the fast marching method code of de Kool et al. (2006).
The original code (v0.7) can be found here: http://rses.anu.edu.au/seismology/soft/fmmcode/
